ðŸš— Pincode Distance API - FastAPI, Google Maps & Redis Caching
A blazing-fast, REST-compliant API built with FastAPI to fetch distance and travel duration between Indian pin codes. Integrates Google Maps Distance Matrix API, uses Redis for caching, and PostgreSQL for persistent storageâ€”perfect for high-efficiency requests without the redundant API costs.

Features
REST API: Fully REST-compliant, no UI. Easily testable with Postman.
Google Maps Integration: Fetches real-time route info (distance & duration) based on pin codes.
Caching with Redis: Avoid redundant calls to Google Maps API; cache results for 1 hour.
PostgreSQL Storage: Persist all route information and save latitude/longitude data for pin codes.
Asynchronous FastAPI: Leveraging FastAPIâ€™s async power for fast responses and concurrency.
Test-Driven Development (TDD): Pytest-ready with structured unit tests to ensure reliability.
